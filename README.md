## project description:
An informative and inspirational site for lgbtqs and allies

## how this project would inspire women to join Learner's Guild
I believe that see a queer affirming and queer positive project on the web would
inspire other queer women to want to do the same. Also, there isn't enough cute
shit in tech. Or enough cute queer shit in the internet world. There should be more cute shit in tech. More positive queer things on the internets.
